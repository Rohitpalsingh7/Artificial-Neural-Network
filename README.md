# Artificial-Neural-Network
Artificial neural network model to predict whether customer will leave the bank or not. 

ANN model is implemented using keras library in python and it used tensorflow backend. 

# Configuration of Clusters 

-- ANN tuning and model evaluation is done on High performance computing clusters (HPC). Configuration of the cluster is K40 with 2 GPUS. It has time limitation of 48 hours and terminate the job exceeding the defined time limit. 

-- Clusters deployed over Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.2

## Steps used for predicting churn rates of customers :
